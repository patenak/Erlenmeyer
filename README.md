Erlenmeyer:

-General area for testing, staging, evaluation, and generalized "what happens when I do X?"

-Nothing is expected to work or be anywhere near completed.

-Cleanups will be perfomed as needed.

-And 'documentation'?... Expect zero in this repo.

-Only repo I treat as the Wild, Wild West. :)
